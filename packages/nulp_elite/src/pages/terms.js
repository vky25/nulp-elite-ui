                    <p>Out of all the consumption clients, only the NULP web portal uses cookies. NULP only uses session cookies, none of the other types of cookies. NULP session cookies are used to store URLs in order to better redirect users to the right pages. For example, when a User signs-in to NULP from the courses page, they'll need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of sign-in for a cleaner user experience. Session cookies are also used to store whether to use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to pull images, plugins and other assets that are shown on the user interface. This is to enable faster loading of the pages the User interacts with. No personal information, or user preferences are stored in cookies.</p>

Doing so, does not impact their user experience on NULP as usage of NULP sets the cookies again. Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings as well. Doing so, will mean that certain things on NULP will not function properly. For eg., images/plugins may take a long time to load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after login.</p>

    <h3><strong>Content Policy of NULP</strong></h3>
    <p><em>(Last updated on&nbsp;</em><em><strong>19-05-2022</strong></em><em>&nbsp;)</em></p>
    <p>This Content Policy sets out the guidelines for content to be followed on NULP. The NULP Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates one of the intentions of NULP - to create a common repository of open content resources for easy access to urban stakeholders across the country. This Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.</p>
    <p>The content creation and curation process on NULP is envisaged to be an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages participation by making it simple to create and share content on the platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators, being the custodians of NULP, frame the guidelines and curation rules, and delegate the authority to curate to the community. This creates a platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of content is ensured by the federated process.</p>
    <p>Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply with respect to Content on NULP. These rules are to be taken seriously as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are requested not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and respect the spirit in which they have been created.</p>
    <p>Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules on appropriateness, accuracy, intellectual property rights and licensing that govern Content on NULP.</p>
